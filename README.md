# Kids First variant-workbench (vwb) on CAVATICA

Note: the beta-version of the Variant Workbench only has row level information for the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC) data. More data will be uploaded soon. 

## What is it? 

The Variant Workbench on CAVATICA fulfills the need of rapid hypothesis testing by allowing users to easily combine patient clinical data, genomic data, and variant annotation in a single workspace. For a longer description, see the Narrative document. 

## References

A list of tables and the columns within are provided in the Reference document. A quick reference guide that maps search functions on the Variant tab of the portal to queries in the VWB is also provided.
