# Kids First variant-workbench (VWB) on CAVATICA

Note: This is a beta release of the Kids First Variant Workbench on CAVATICA, for approved beta testers only. The beta-version of the Variant Workbench only has row level information for the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC) data. More data will be uploaded soon. We welcome your feedback to help guide future development of the VWB. 

## What is it? 

The Variant Workbench on CAVATICA fulfills the need of rapid hypothesis testing by allowing users to easily combine patient clinical data, genomic data, and variant annotation in a single workspace. For a longer description, see the Narrative document.
